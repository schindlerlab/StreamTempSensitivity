Extending the analysis of Lisi et al. 2013 to examine the relationship between watershed geomorphology, snowpack and stream temperature sensitivity to changes in air temperature. Dynamic factor analyses are fit to stream temperature data every year with air temperature and 1-day lagged air temperatures as covariates.
